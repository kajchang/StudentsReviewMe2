TURTLE BOOK FTW!!Submitted by a student", "Mr. Wenning is probably the best biology teacher at Lowell. I had him for two semesters freshman year. Don't listen to the people who say he's hard!

If you study, do the homework, and participate in class you can get an A.", "If you are looking to actually learn biology, take him.

You have to write long form two rows, and short form one row for each word.....", "She makes you do a lot of projects, and she rarely teaches you any of the characters or how you write them. All you do every day is read from the textbook and discuss about projects (when there are any on that day).", "She's alright I guess but she should be more lenient.

AND i can't/ don't speak it at home. in her class, all you have to do is memorize a bunch of characters and do well on skits. be sure to chose a good group if you can. she makes really funny jokes and there's not too much work. i like how we get to tell her how the projects went an essay so she can take that into consideration instead of basing our grades on only the performance.", "Wow, I've had her for one semester, and she is already growing annoying. She has to be one of the worst teachers I've ever had. She will make you do her silly projects almost one after another. She is one of the fastest French teachers.

As long as you participate, she will give you an A.", "I know many people hate her and think she's a bad teacher, and I once thought that from rumors. But I took her for an extended period of time, she's not a bad teacher. She's not that hard and doesn't give that much homework. Just study a couple days in advance before the test and you'll ace it.

She's a sympathetic teacher outside of class, so she will listen to your concerns.", "Pang is not a good teacher by any standards.

You get about 15-25 minutes to get into class and you can talk and socialized and she teaches for 20-30 minutes.", "Here's an honest review: Ms Pang is a good teacher. She's a hard grader, but like all teachers at Lowell, you get out of the class what you put in. Make the effort to enjoy the class, and it will be one of your favorites. Come in with preconceived notions, and you'll hate it with a passion no matter what. Her skits and tests are not that hard if you try to be creative and have fun with them. You do yourself a disservice by trusting rumors.", "Most people say that you shouldn't take her because of the fact that she does cummultive tests. She is a very interesting and entertaining teacher actually. I find her class quite amusing.", "ms. pang isn't as bad as people say she is.", "Ms. Pang isn't as bad as people say she is. I have had her for about a year and I haven't had much trouble besides on the cumulative test. If you turn in all your homework, participate (tough in participation grades), and do bad on the test, then there's a possibility that you can get a B/C in her class. In her class you don't learn much sentence structure or have dictation on the test but only vocabulary. I think it's easier to get a good grade that way. She's not a flaming hell. Jesus.", "She plays favorites. If she likes you, she'll have sympathy for you if you do bad on the tests. If she hates you, then you better STUDYSTUDYSTUDY. she likes to get off topic and talk about her stories to Paris, some of them are helpful, and some of them are just a waste of time.", "Honestly, she's not as bad as people say she is. The only bad thing is that she gives cumulative tests but in the end you start to remember old characters instead of forgetting them. Turn in ALL your homework and participate. If you fail the test, you can still get a C in the class. She's really a fair grader. Alot of skits but it benefits you if you fail her tests. If you get As on the skits, you can get a B even with Fs on tests. People who get Ds in her class OBVIOUSLY haven't tried studying.", "Seriously, you will always have a bad teacher in your life - and Ms. Pang may be one of them. However, just live with it. There's no point in complaining so just study as if it was any other class and try your best. She will give you an A if you ace all your tests.

Just manage it and it will all eventually come to an end.", "Not the best choice for a teacher, is all I'll start with. First of all, she isn't very friendly toward new students, as I had to learn the processes from other students and I had to get the character graphs from them too. Secondly, she tends to brag about her achievements including the time she stood up to a judge, and fought off an attacker.

She says things before skits to make you feel pressured and nervous.", "i disliked her at first. she doesn't teach much but i have a pretty strong chinese foundation so if youre shaky i suggest you not take her. mostly copying from the book, skits, projects, reading tests, participation is always a plus, and i think she plays favorites too. tests you on ALL chinese characters youve ever learned and she doesn't go by the book. and she has this feigned \"niceness\" which is scary -short tempered especially when you ask her for help.", "i have her for french and she always tries to threaten our grade, \"this is going on your citizenship grade\", etc", "i didn't learn anything but characters in Pang. i don't even know how to use the characters. i'm not even sure if her definition is correct. all i need to know is the pingyin and im set. i hate skits. you don't really have to worry about this class though, maybe once in awhile.", "What can I say... This is an example of a horrible excuse of a \"teacher.\" It's like her sole responsibility at Lowell is to make lives miserable if not ruin them completely. I put so much effort into this class and got nothing, a D. I studied the Chinese book everyday, but it doesn't even matter. Real teachers DON'T just grade based on memorization of characters, level of skit gimmicks, and how much they like you. Not once in class did we have to demonstrate real understanding of Chinese", "She told us that we could choose our own groups. But then a minute later, she looked at my group and said that we couldn't be together.

He doesn't teach as well as Cooley only because his philosophy is that students shouldn't be spoon fed every single piece of information. He believes in being able to problem-solve b/c that's an essential skill in life. Tests are easy if you studied and understood the concepts independently, but hard if you don't do anything in the class and don't enjoy learning physics yourself.", "I love Mr. Prothro he is probably my favorite teacher at Lowell. He is such a wonderful person and is more like a friend than a teacher. He tries to make class as interesting as possible but sadly it's still pretty tough if you're not good at sciences. He grades you based off if he thinks you understand the stuff or not and the final and not really the homework (which he asignes only right before tests). Better than Ms. D by far though.", "he does fun and interesting activities in class that keep you involved. laid back guy who doesn't really take attendance so you don't really have to go to class all the time. he explains things well once and doesn't really have many days out of the week that he explains stuff, he just gives problems for you to do and demonstrates how to do them which is helpful at times. pretty tough tests if you don't fully get the concepts, but a really fun guy.", "Chill class. Not the best teacher, but makes up for it by doing fun activities and being very laid back. Easy B, but really hard A. Not really sure how he does his grading, but it seems like it's from his impressions of you and your tests rather than points.", "Don't let my ratings fool you, i had him for honors, and this is how everyone can get a B. Turn in homework..eventually, and if you pay attention, and get all the conceptuals, you should get 50-70% on the tests, you can pull out a B/B+", "Took him for regular physics. At first I really liked him, thought he and his class were chill and he was a good teacher (at least in comparison with ms. d 1st semester) but now I realize he doesn't really teach. really hard tests but huge curves. easy B, very hard A. Bit of a narcissist but I guess pretty chill. you can skip class sometimes, come in late, not turn in some stuff, and he won't really care. I didn't personally like him too much but a lot of people do", "One of the best experiences you can have at Lowell. Not the easiest by far, but definitely the most fun. You will constantly by mindblown! (Boomerangs, bows, whips, insane frisbee skills). His grading is curved to your own class, e.g class average was 9/40, a 15/40 is an A. His homework is very light, Also, great guy to talk to for just about anything, funny stories all the time, and always interested in whatever you have to say. If you arn't very talkative, you won't get the full experience.", "Took him for regular Physics F'11. Awesome teacher. Before class he'll ask if you anything to share with the class and if it's interesting, he might continue to talk about it and get off topic sometimes (takes up class time). Says he doesn't believe in homework and that tests show more.Was assigned", "This is a somewhat exciting class. Test scores, however, have little to no impact on your actual grade. He gives you a grade based on what he personally thinks you know, not what is reflected by your tests. He's also extremely condescending.", "Please take Prothro if you can. He's great. I bombed all the tests and did the homework and still got a C. He WILL NOT fail you if you come to class, which is nice. He's a great guy and explains well.

He's a great teacher!", "taking prothro will be the best classroom experience you will have at lowell. it's my 2nd semester senior year, and his physics class is the best. he's fun, really chill, makes physics really interesting, and doesn't get mad at you ever. just don't be uptight, let him work his magic.", "sometimes its hard to understand what he is talking about but when he talks to you one on one it clicks. he is super cool and friendly, but you dont learn as much... take him if you can !", "ok so hes really tight. and he really got me fascinated about physics. He presents the information clearly and if you were to go home and think about the material for about five minutes it would all make sense. Physics is not easy to teach, but he really does a good job. if you can get him, take him", "I had him for Physics in F06/S07. Cool guy, not so great as a teacher. I'm sure he knows the material, but the delivery isn't what it needs to be for us to understand. It sometimes seems like he's more into having fun than teaching the class. It doesn't fit at Lowell -- we want fun AND learning.", "he's actually improving in his teaching recently and i'm glad that is the case... sure, i'll take the B (bleh) but at least I know i learned something along the way.. keep it up, prothro.", "when the principal came in to evaluate him, prothro taught. but hear me when i say that he does NOT teach the rest of the time!!! he just gives us problems (which are usually crazy hard, that way, he gets to", "Hes gives stduents a B as long as they put effort into their work. He doesn't really follow his own syllabus. You can get A's and B's on tests, which are worth half your grade, and get full credit on labs and homework, which is worth the other half, and still get a B. I think he just doesn't like to give A's. He doesn't really teach you how to do the hard problems he assigns. He just throws them at you and lets you figure them out with your group so if you don't have a good group, you're screwed", "Mr. Prothro's hella tight. Can relate to the students, but still makes sure everyone is respectful. Workload is light, but he still expects you to at least try to understand the material. Lectures are paired with interesting demonstrations and usually keep people at least partly-interested. Tests can be quite challenging, but you get a B as long as you try. People who he sees truly understands the material and makes an effort will get an A.", "PROTHRO'S A 'G! i have him for physics H. love him and love the material/class. barely any hw. tests r tough-ish. awesome overall person and great teacher too. its surprising how much i can learn every unit from a couple of demonstration days (where we do cool experiments in class) and some days where we do fun problems in class while talking and stuff. you get to go outside occasionally and learn physics first-hand too. my most looked forward to and fun class.", "Good class for slackers because he doesnt give less than a B (usually) but not good for serious students. He doesnt teach that much, his tests are too hard, and doesn't like to give As.", "Fair grader, doesn't give lower than a B unless you don't try at all. If you want an A you actually have to do well on the quizzes. Occasionally on days when there's nothing to do we'll play ultimate frisbee or taboo, which is always fun :) Very little tests and homework during the second semester, but kind of a lot during the first semester.", "Easy B, Hard A. Personally, I think that outlining the chapters is pretty pointless. The hw he gives is fair enough. The quizzes every Friday are a killer though. Haha. I'm gonna cut him some slack since he's fairly new. He'll get better with experience. My suggestion is that he should assign a section of a chapter to be read a night + 5 questions pertaining to the reading rather than assigning one whole chapter a week. That is Mr. Wenning's method and I found it to be really effective.", "He's a very cool teacher...but he gives WAY TOO MUCH homework...outlining and the Q parts of the questions are alot of work...take him if you want conceptual physics...mr. cooley is better in my opinion just becuase hes more math based and gives less hw", "He's a very nice and laid back teacher.

Just know the theorems and formulas, and the frequent quizzes will be easy. [: Just be careful!", "I had Costa for a WHOLE YEAR of algebra. He's pretty stubborn at times. He doesn't count homework, but sometimes he will check if you do them or not. If you don't do them.. he will minus points.. and that can affect your grade.

Don't cut his class or he's ON TO you until you have a re-admit or admit you cut class. He has multiple choice algebra tests..", "I warn you, do not take Costa.

Mr.F was the only teacher I ever had that applied the lesson into real life scenario. His tests are multiple choice, and easy if you study pay attention in class.

Last year, I was struggling in Accel., so it's a relief to find math understandable and fun again.

Now i think instead of letting student do more work on their own in class for precal he should do more examples to demonstrates new stuff.

If you are looking for a teacher that takes things relatively slow and does not teach straight from the book, Okada is the one to take. She often plays little games in class (which can be embarrassing) but fun. Her homework is bearable and she makes it clear what she does/does not want. If you study in her class, you will do fine.

G!!!", "I loved taking his AP World class! Not only is he knowledgeable in world history, but he's also very helpful and understanding. His class is extremely fun, and you definitely learn a lot in his class. He prepares you well for the AP exam, but additional self-studying (as in reading AP review books for the AP exam) is suggested for the last grading period. He's very funny and experienced, and overall, he's an amazing teacher! If I could take his class again, I definitely would! :)", "So I had Mr. Girling for AP World, I think he is a great teacher!!!!!!!!!!! He understand we have a lot of assignment from other classes.

Kudos to Girling for instilling that challenge early on! It has prepared me well for academics beyond HS.", "Most amazing teacher EVER. Hands down.", "I had him for AP world and hes pretty lenient compared to all the other AP world teachers. his grading system is really weird though and sometimes things that arent important affect your grade more than say, a test.

He is very unclear and grades very harshly. His class is sooo much work. Hes nice though! NOT an easyA", "I had him several years ago. He was a really kind, fun, and easygoing teacher.

He's a nice guy, even though he picks on people when no one raises their hands.

But once he started focusing more on current events and politics (e.g. 2008 Presidential election), it became much more interesting. Moderate amount of readings that he expects to be notated.

He's a very nice guy who will listen to what you have to say.", "Fun teacher, really great guy and I learned a lot from him. Requires you to read from the book and outline chapters but doesn't expect much (his TAs grade them). Lectures are boring but he lets you eat in class and usually doesn't pick on you.

His assignments are academically pointless but you learn how to write a letter to the editor, survey people, debate, etc. We never opened our American Democracy books once. Finally, you most definately need to participate in the class. Every single grade makes the biggest difference because of his strange and flawed grading system.", "he is so awsome he is super nice easy a if you try hard, make you a great essay writer, teaches you about the rest of the world, this man is a saint. Study chronology and thats the hardest part of the test", "I never really liked him much. I feel like I had two English teachers when I had him. Part of his MW final was food, as in you make your own food and bring it and give yourself an A. Another part is to bring a sample of music which you still give yourself an A. And that's 20% of your third trimester grade. I got a B on his final with over 50 guesses, and doodled in my notebook every lecture. He is a guy that really teaches about the Modern World as in (insert today's date here.)", "he tries. he's too easy sometimes. at other times he's too hard. there are some pointless, annoying assignments, too. he sometiems makes us do really stupid stuff, and gives us very little time to do it. but he actually cares about his students. he likes those who have intelligent things to say in class. participation is a literal part of your grade, so you better speak up", "Pretty easy class for modern world... focused more on the region part than the actual learning from the book part. Lectures are super boring, no need to pay attention in class. Hard essay grader, but very lenient on notes (do well on themes, that's it). Tests are easy too, just skim the chapter the night before or morning of. You grade yourself on some parts, so yeah, not so hard. Not much of a chance to learn, though, because he's such a boring lecturer and no one listens. Easy A in the end.", "If you want to get an \"A\" in his class, here are 3 tips 1) Do NOT procrastinate. Procrastination will give you a slim chance of getting an \"A\". 2) Study HARD for his tests, ESPECIALLY FOR THE FINAL!!! Slacking off will result in a low grade. 3) Participate in his class.

I learned so much that I bombed the AP test.Submitted by a student", "( For World History) He is a great lecture and i learned so much. But, his class is really hard. His test you need to study for really hard. He will help you with projects but it is still hard. But, you will learn a lot in his class. It was really cool at the end of the semester we talk about things going on in our world like global warmingSubmitted by a student", "Mr. Tuason is the best combo for a teacher. He is challenging and will make you work and learn a lot. At the same time, it's easy to get a good grade because there are a lot of small reading quizzes and tons of extra credit opportunities. The one thing I struggle with is the unit exams. They are multiple choice, but get very specific and are tough to study for. Other than that, he is a great teacher. He is knowledgeable, strict, funny, and friendly.Submitted by a student", "A very intimidating serious guy. Deep in the inside he's funny but his class is honestly challenging. Chill lectures but a fair amount of daily reading for homework and daily quizzes in modern world. His class is a great prep for AP World! If you have a chance, take him, he really prepares you for time management! Not an easy A but with all those extra credit, I brought up my C to an A within a grading period. A very awesome intellectual person!!!Submitted by a student", "It's been three years since I've had Mr. Tuason as a history teacher, but he was one of the most inspiring teachers that I had. His lesson on the civil rights movement and peoples movements were the most memorable and I find myself seeing the connections that he introduced now that I'm more involved in the community. I hope he's still inspiring students with his explanation of the fist of solidarity. Keep fighting the good fight, Mr. Tuason!Submitted by a student", "Smart man. Got me a 5 on the APUSH exam.

Amazing teacher!Submitted by a student", "Mr. Tuason seemed really intimidating on the first day of school, but he's actually really funny. He makes you work and gives many extra credit opportunities, which means he doesn't round up for your final grade. If you get a 89.9% it's your loss for not doing the extra credit. He also does reading quizzes, which I suggest you take notes on the section assigned to you that night, since it's a pretty big chunk of your grade. Mr Tuason's class isn't a walk in the park, but it's definitely worth itSubmitted by a student", "Mr. Tuason seems quite strict at first but is actually really nice and funny. He incorporates a lot of fun elements into his class such as kickball, dressing up, debates, posters, timelines, interesting films, potlucks, newspapers etc. Basically, if you don't like projects, you wouldn't like his class. The reading every night and quizzes everyday may seem discouraging but since there are so many grades in your grade book, the little quizzes don't count as much and there is room for error.Submitted by a student", "Mr. Tuason's class is definitely intense- there's a lot of work and the tests are fairly challenging. However, he prepares you really well for the AP test, probably even more than you need to know for a 5.

He put a lot of his own money and time into helping us learn and score well on the test.Submitted by a student", "Hardest teacher I have ever had. I have had literal breakdowns because of the workload. Reading quizzes everyday he assigns you a section from the textbook, you better know ever damn date, name, and statistic in that section. Nonstop projects, a lot of them are in partners. When he's moody, he is not afraid to cuss you out so you really have no idea what will tick him off. However he does know his stuff very well and you really do learn a lot. Not an easy A but very possible. Lot of extra cred", "His teaching style is very intense, but Mr. Tuason is very intelligent and can usually answer any questions you have about history off the top of his head. He claims he doesn't like kids, but he will provide support if you need it. All the memorization adds a lot of stress to students' lives though. I will say that when you're in his class you will learn no matter what and gain a solid understanding of whatever subject you are learning.", "take him if you dont like to fall asleep in class, very funny and entertaining, not your easy a but if u do the extra credit and study you should be fine. he is very good at explaining and you feel comfortable asking him questions", "He seems very scary and mean at first but he's really not.

He makes class fun and light, yet still challenging. He usually has competitions for each topic we learn that are super fun, like when we frosted cupcakes and he was able to relate it to the Civil War. Or when we played pictionary, made paper airplanes and footballs and related that to the Cold War. It was so epic! lol.", "He was a great American Democracy teacher! After the first month of adjusting to Lowell, Mr. Tuason really picked it up. He showed interesting videos that connected with what we learned and gave projects. The presidential campaign project was my favorite! He had us create campaign posters, plan a fundraiser, and make tv commericals to either promote our candidate or do some mudslinging against an opponent. I loved how his projects let us use what we learned in such a creative outlet! Take him!", "His teaching techniques include: ppt lectures, videos, class games/activities, group/research/art projects, written tests (usually open notes), and now, unfortunately, textbook readings and a multi-choice final exam (some ppl complained). He is very open minded and teaches his students in many different perspectives that the textbook fails to do. His lectures are thorough, interesting, and memorable. Cool, fun guy until you get him pissed. Once you do, prepare for a Tuason Typhoon of HELL and HW", "Mr. T is a good history teacher. He makes us understand why things happened in history instead of just telling us what happened. He also gives us perspectives that arnt found in the book. There are a lot of projects (usually 1 for each topic) and have to do tons or research for those. He also has lots of activities that help us understand history.

I used to hate history but he made me start loving it lol. This is my second semester taking him and im really lucky to have been able to do so.

Trust me, you wont regret it.", "Most people think Mr. Tuason is easy because he doesn't give homework and their aren't many quizes or test but that doesn't mean his class is an easy A. He gives research projects and presentations. His extra credit isn't taht easy either, you actually have to do lots of work to get extra credit. He's really cool to talk to. If you ask him about his view on teaching, youll understand why his classes do lots of projects.Not an easy A because he grades tough but you should take him!", "Mr. T is alright. His lectures get pretty long sometimes, but its not too bad. He does give a lot of projects tho. I'm pretty sure that the person below was commenting on the timeline project (we did one for MoWo to). But the review below is wrong, Mr. T doesn't grade on the quality of the artwork, but he does grade on required number of images that have to be drawn. Jeopardy is actually based on his previous lectures so its only review of stuff we already covered.", "Had for modern world. He explains everything pretty well in his lectures, but you have to take a lot of notes. Doesn't give many tests or homework. Most of your grade is group projects and essays. Offers extra credit if you teach the class for a day.

It takes quite a bit of effort to get an A, but it is worth it.", "He's a great history teacher. I like how his teaching isn't mostly depended on lectures, but instead on activities.

The fundamental goal is for all students to make sense of the mathematics they are learning, and for this reason all units are designed around four challenging tasks connected by lesson series. The tasks require that students find patterns, make and test conjectures, use multiple representations and approaches, make generalizations, and verify that solutions are reasonable in a given context.This is the second mathematics course for high school students aligned to the Common Core State Standards for mathematics. The course begins with transformations in the plane, concept of congruence through rigid motions, and similarity through dilations. Relationships established through transformational geometry are used to prove geometric theorems. Similarity leads to a study of right triangles and trigonometric ratios. A focus on expressing geometric properties with equations leads to using coordinates to prove theorems algebraically. The course also examines relationships between 2- and 3-dimensional objects, including volume formulas and modeling with geometry.
